# Cryptography
Implementation of Cryptographic Algorithms in C++

## Caesar Cipher
Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter of the alphabet is substituted by a letter a certain distance away from that letter

./Cryptography cipher key  process pathFrom pathTo

## Monoalphabetic Cipher
Monoalphabetic cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter of the plaintext is replaced with another letter. This technique uses a random key for every single letter

./Cryptography cipher seed process pathFrom pathTo
