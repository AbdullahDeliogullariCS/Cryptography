# Cryptography
Implementation of Cryptographic Algorithms in C++

## Caesar Cipher
Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter of the alphabet is substituted by a letter a certain distance away from that letter


## Monoalphabetic Cipher
Monoalphabetic cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter of the plaintext is replaced with another letter. This technique uses a random key for every single letter


## Polyalphabetic Cipher
Polyalphabetic substitution cipher is a series of simple substitution ciphers. It is used to change each character of the plaintext with a variable length.


## Data Encryption Standard
Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a block cipher algorithm that takes plain text in blocks of 64 bits and converts them to ciphertext using keys of 48 bits.
It is a symmetric key algorithm, which means that the same key is used for encrypting and decrypting ​data.

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
The Diffie–Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.
