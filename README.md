# Cryptography
Implementation of Cryptographic Algorithms in C++

## Caesar Cipher
Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter of the alphabet is substituted by a letter a certain distance away from that letter


## Monoalphabetic Cipher
Monoalphabetic cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter of the plaintext is replaced with another letter. This technique uses a random key for every single letter


## Polyalphabetic Cipher
Polyalphabetic substitution cipher is a series of simple substitution ciphers. It is used to change each character of the plaintext with a variable length.


## Data Encryption Standard
Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a block cipher algorithm that takes plain text in blocks of 64 bits and converts them to ciphertext using keys of 48 bits.
It is a symmetric key algorithm, which means that the same key is used for encrypting and decrypting ​data.

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
The Diffie–Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.

## Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Algorithm

Public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, uses two different but mathematically linked keys -- one public and one private. The public key can be shared with everyone, 
whereas the private key must be kept secret. In RSA cryptography, both the public and the private keys can encrypt a message; the opposite key from the one used to encrypt a message is used to decrypt it.
